This is still in progress. It may never work cause I started it just for fun. The way I have to change all the concept is that there is a parent contract which is the owner of the actual monopoly parties contracts. This is in order to ensure there's not any kind of coalition between one or another so everytime a player joins a match it is randomly put in any of the child contracts.
